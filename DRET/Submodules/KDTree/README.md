# KDTree

### Description

3D KDTree for Unity, with fast construction and fast & thread-safe querying, with minimal memory garbage.

### It was designed:

* to be working with Unity Vector3 structs, but can be modified to work with any other 3D (or 2D & 4D or higher) struct/arrays
* for speedy & light Construction & Reconstruction,
* to be light on memory, everything is pooled,
* for fast querying, 
* queryable from multiple threads (thread-safe),

### Query modes:
* K-Nearest
* Closest point query
* Radius query
* Interval query

### How to use

#### Construction

First you need some array of points.

Example:

```cs
Vector3[] pointCloud = new Vector3[10000];

for(int i = 0; i < pointCloud.Length; i++)
	pointCloud[i] = Random.insideUnitSphere;
```

Then build the tree out of it. Note that original pointCloud shouldn't change, since tree is referencing it!

Note: Higher maxPointsPerLeafNode makes construction of tree faster, but querying slower.
And true is inverse: Lower maxPointsPerLeafNode makes construction of tree slower, but querying faster.
```cs
int maxPointsPerLeafNode = 32;
KDTree tree = new KDTree(pointCloud, maxPointsPerLeafNode);
```

#### Reconstruction

If you wish to update points and reconstruct tree, you do it like this:

```cs
for(int i = 0; i < tree.Count; i++) {
    tree.Points[i] += Func(tree.Points[i]);
}

tree.Rebuild();
```

Such rebuilding will be with zero GC impact.

Other functions for rebuilding (data will be copied from array/list, not reference!).
```cs
public void Build(Vector3[] newPoints, int maxPointsPerLeafNode = -1);
public void Build(List<Vector3> newPoints, int maxPointsPerLeafNode = -1);
```

#### Querying

Now that tree has been constructed, make a KDQuery object. 

Note: if you wish to do querying from multiple threads, then each own thread should have it's own KDQuery object.

```cs
Query.KDQuery query = new Query.KDQuery();
```

For most query methods you need pre-initialized results list & reference to tree that you wish to query.
Results list will contain indexes for pointCloud array.

List should be cleared; but it's not necesary to clear it (if you wish to do multiple queries), but this way you will have duplicate indexes.

Query objects should be re-used, since it pools everything - to avoid unnecesarry allocations and deallocations.
```cs
List<int> results = new List<int>();

// spherical query
query.Radius(tree, position, radius, results);

// returns k nearest points         
query.KNearest(tree, position, k, results);

// bounds query
query.Interval(tree, min, max, results);

// closest point query
query.ClosestPoint(tree, position, results);
```

#### Post Query

If you wish to do something with query results, then use it like this:
```cs
for(int i = 0; i < results.Count; i++) {
	
	Vector3 p = pointCloud[results[i]];
	Draw(p);
}
```

### Demos

Those demos show rebuilding tree & querying of Live Lorenz Attractor point cloud.

### How it works?

#### Construction

Uses internal permutation array, so it doesn't modify original data array. Permutation is identity array at first (arr[i] = i), then gets sorted down the line.
Hoare partitioning enables to sort permutation array inplace. (Quicksort uses hoare partitioning, too).
Mid-point rule is used for node splitting - not the most optimal split but makes construction much faster.

#### KDQuery

All traversal nodes are pooled in internal queue.
Uses binary heap for KNearest query. Heaps for all sizes are pooled inside KDQuery object.

### Jobified KDTree

There is heavily modified version of this source, that runs on Unity Job System (not made by me).
Also note that tests are wrong - you are supposed to reuse Query objects, not always create new ones, hence the GC.
