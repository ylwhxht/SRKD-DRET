# Vehicle Tools

This sample project provides a series of tools to rig wheeled vehicles and
easily create suspension for physics-based wheel colliders.

A Vehicle Skeleton Rigging Wizard is available in the top drop-down menu,
providing options for vehicles with multiple axle types and behaviors.
The project also includes a range of simple example vehicles and useful
diagnostic tools to monitor the behavior of your wheel colliders.

Can also be found on the Asset Store.
